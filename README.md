# Graphics/Math Toolkit (GMTK) 
### Also known as GMath

GMTK is a C++ library that provides efficient and flexible math utility for the purpose of graphics programming, game programming, and fields with similar requirements. The toolkit boasts matrix and vector classes which are templated by value type and by dimension. The entire library is defined in header files, and math code is implemented generically in a manner which allows for efficient runtime calculations. The entire library is free-to-use under the terms of the MIT License.
